          <p>TN was formed on the 10 May 2018. The first independent community print media, reporting different stories in rural areas. 
             For almost 3 years,&nbsp;the Turnstar Newspaper has been serving the community as the source of people living in rural areas
            when it comes to the news that matters.&nbsp;Since starting as a small family run newspaper, we have grown with the city,
            telling the stories of the capital, its people and their interests.
		 </p> <br>
         <p>The management of TN consists of Chief News Reporter (CNR), Marketing Manager (MM), Operations Manager and Finance Manager (FM). </p><br><br>
